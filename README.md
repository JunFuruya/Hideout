# Ratsnake
This is my web crawler made of Python, whose name takes after that of a snake living in Japan, not of a python, because no python lives in Japan.

# Why I picked "snake", not "python."
Although I wanted to express that the app was a python-app made in Japan, there is no wild python in the country.
Hence, I had to pick a name of a tiny snake, which I have really seen before.
